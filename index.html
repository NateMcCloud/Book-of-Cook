	    <p>I'm Nate Bodine, and you've reached my Book of Cook! Here is where I record all the recipes I come across through the internet, word of mouth, and my own experimentation. This started out as a simple little project to test my skills with XML and XSLT, but I grew more and more attached to it as time went on. Now, it's a full-fledged cookbook! Be careful, though, because not everything here is edible...you'll know which recipes those are, though.</p>
	    <p>Note that most of the recipes I got from other people and from websites are not word-for-word, but I've paraphrased them, as some of them were&#8230;somewhat difficult to read.</p>
